{"name":"ARTOS-D2","tagline":"Android Real Time Operating System","body":"ARTOS-D2 is a real time Android kernel for the Nexus 5 mobile phone. This project is developed in the UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech), Barcelona.\r\n\r\nGo to the list of bugs and solutions.\r\n\r\n## The people\r\nAlthough Marc Marí is the one named in the commits, there's other people behind the scenes: professors Eduard Alarcón and Xavier Martorell, PhD candidates Carles Araguz and Elisenda Bou, and student Arnau Prat. Without them, and other smaller contributions, this result wouldn't be possible.\r\n\r\n## The project\r\nIn fall 2013, professor Eduard Alarcón and PhD candidate Elisenda Bou were awarded a Google Faculty Research Award for the Android Beyond the Stratosphere (ABS) project.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop an open-source, standardized, modular and low-cost nano-satellite platform based on commercial-off-the-shelf components and open standards. This platform will be based on an Android phone which won't be used just a processing core, but also as a sensing and communication core. And this phone will be complemented with an open hardware platform where payloads and experiments can be deployed.\r\n\r\nIn the satellite context, it is important to have Real Time capabilities because of the harsh environment. It is important to control a number of sensors and other hardware, and react when their values change. For example, if a charged particle hits a circuit and causes a subsystem to malfunction or stop, this has to be reflected in the software state as soon as possible, so it can be solved. But it is not necessary to have a hard real time operating system. There are no events that can happen and cannot admit some latency margin.\r\n\r\n## The name\r\nARTOS stands for Android Real Time Operating System. In its spanish pronunciation, ARTOS is really similar to R2. From this point, is easy to think of R2-D2, or the famous little robot (or android) in Start Wars. So ARTOS-D2.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
