        <p>ARTOS-D2 is a real time Android kernel for the Nexus 5 mobile phone. This project is developed in the UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech), Barcelona.</p>

<p>Although Marc Marí is the one named in the commits, there's other people behind the scenes: professors Eduard Alarcón and Xavier Martorell, PhD candidates Carles Araguz and Elisenda Bou, and student Arnau Prat. Without them, and other smaller contributors, this project wouldn't be possible.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-project" class="anchor" href="#the-project" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project history</h2>

<p>In fall 2013, professor Eduard Alarcón and PhD candidate Elisenda Bou were awarded a Google Faculty Research Award for the Android Beyond the Stratosphere (ABS) project.</p>

<p>This project aims to develop an open-source, standardized, modular and low-cost nano-satellite platform based on commercial-off-the-shelf components and open standards. This platform will be based on an Android phone which won't be used just a processing core, but also as a sensing and communication core. And this phone will be complemented with an open hardware platform where payloads and experiments can be deployed.</p>

<p>In the satellite context, it is important to have real time capabilities because of the harsh environment. It is important to control a number of sensors and other hardware, and react when their values change. And hence, this ARTOS-D2 project.</p>

<p>But this project is not exclusive of the satellite environment. This kernel is a standard real time operating system which can be used on top of a Nexus 5 mobile phone, in any area where real time is necessary.</p>

<a id="the-name" class="anchor" href="#the-name" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The name</h2>

<p>ARTOS stands for Android Real Time Operating System. In its spanish pronunciation, ARTOS is really similar to R2. From this point, is easy to think of R2-D2, or the famous little robot (or android) in Start Wars. So ARTOS-D2.</p>
